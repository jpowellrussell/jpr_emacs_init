;; here, these are the settings that I pretty much want on to make Emacs usable
;; that do not rely on a package Packages are configured in their own init
;; files, called from a package-list init file.  Is this sloppy? I dunno, I guess
;; I'll learn.

;;; Code:
;; =============================================================================
;; Personal Global Preferences
;; =============================================================================
;; Very likely I'll merge this section with the Emacs4developers Recommended
;; Configuration as I come to be more comfortable with them and decide whether I
;; want to keep them. So far, so good.

;; My preferred fixed-width font
(set-frame-font "Inconsolata-14")

;; My preferred variable-pitch font

;; Removes the GUI tool bar at the top of the window, because it's ugly, and why
;; use that in Emacs?
(tool-bar-mode -1)

(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(fullscreen .  maximized))

;; Select Help Window after opening it (for easy closing, mostly)

;; Automatically insert line breaks in white space before the 80 column mark
(setq-default fill-column 80)
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook (lambda () fill-column 79))

;; I've disabled auto-fill and gone to visual line mode instead, mostly for more
;; attractive variable-pitch editing, but also for easier copy/pasting into
;; variable pitch editors like Outlook and Word. I may revisit this, as I think
;; actually filled columns improve editor-agnostic human readability of plain
;; text files, which helps their longevity and portability.
;; (setq-default auto-fill-function 'do-auto-fill)

;; since that convention is now less common and deprecated by many

;; If you typing or pasting over a selection, deletes the highlighted text,
;; making it behave more as expected from previous text-editor experience

;; I changed this to take away the code excluding Treemacs, which apparently
;; handles this itself

;; modified to place the default top-level array inside an object and to give
;; the array the label "groups", and any URLs that have a percentage sign will
;; need to have those replaced by a double percentage sign '%%' so that the

;; read a json properly. Some of my confusion was just getting the syntax of
;; dolist wrong (I didn't enclose the arguments in a list at first), but it also

;; default to making the top level an object, which by default is a hash table.
